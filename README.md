# Machine Equipment Integration System

### My Freelance Project with VSTO Development

Welcome to my freelance project! This project was initiated based on user requests, and I've chosen to implement it using VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office).


### VSTO Integration

Our project leverages VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office), a technology by Microsoft that enhances the integration of our solution with Microsoft Office applications. VSTO allows us to seamlessly extend and customize Office functionalities, providing users with a more robust and tailored experience.

**Technology Stack:** Our project utilizes VSTO alongside .NET Framework.

For more details on VSTO, refer to the official [VSTO documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/vsto/office-solutions-development-overview-vsto?view=vs-2022).
